# Bayesian Registration of Functional Data
## Project for the Bayesian Statistics course - MSc in Mathematical Engineering 

The data-set we worked with contains observations of the flexion-extension angle of a knee during aone leg hoop over time. We have 2 thousand sampling times for each observation and We analyzed data coming from three groups of people: people who just had surgery, people that are in physicaltherapy or that had done it in the past, and healthy people. The healty subjects represent the control group in our study. To see how we uploaded and visualized our data see [Import_Data](https://github.com/PrincipeFederica/Bayesian-Principe-Mattina-Bighignoli/blob/main/Import_data.R) file.

The aim of this project was to align those curves. The data are private so we can not upload the original dataset, but to show that the algortihm for the alignment actually worked, we will upload the simulated curves that we used to check the performances of our algorithm. See the [simulated_functions](https://github.com/PrincipeFederica/Bayesian-Principe-Mattina-Bighignoli/blob/main/simulated_functions.R) file. The plotted curves are in the folder [Plots](https://github.com/PrincipeFederica/Bayesian-Principe-Mattina-Bighignoli/tree/main/Plots) under the name *gruppo_controllo*, *gruppo_fisioterapia*, *gruppo_surgery*.
