# Bayesian Registration of Functional Data-Principe-Mattina-Bighignoli
Project for the Bayesian Statistics course - MSc in Mathematical Engineering 

The data-set we worked with contains observations of the flexion-extension angle of a knee during aone leg hoop over time. We have 2 thousand sampling times for each observation and We analyzed data coming from three groups of people: people who just had surgery, people that are in physicaltherapy or that had done it in the past, and healthy people. The healty subjects represent the control group in our study.

The aim of this project was to align those curves
